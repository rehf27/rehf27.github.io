## Hello and welcome

End of the Line logs my experiences learning and using technology on a wide-array of small personal and collaborative projects.  Sometimes I will write about it, sometimes I'll record a video or stream, and sometimes all do all those things.  My objective is to learn and have fun.  Life and work often take my attention and free time away, but I will endeavor to remain consistent.  I also enjoy playing video games so keep a look out for those videos and streams.

## Current projects:

- [Yeoman Generator for AWS  Lambda](https://github.com/rehf27/generator-lambda-function)
- [Bungeecord+Spigot using Docker](https://github.com/rehf27/docker-bungeecord)
- Alexa Skills for Amazon Echo
- Microservices PaaS (Node.js + Docker + NGINX)
- Meteor + React
